    "1. While Big Mountain's current pricing is on the higher end of the state distribution, it is one of few states that charge the same ticket price for weekday and weekend admission. The majority of states charge more for weekend admission and hence there seems to be flexibility in weekend pricing at minimum.\n",
    "2. Big Mountain's pricing is already an outlier for the state, yet business has been consistent and profitable. This hints at the possiblity that people are willing to pay more for the services that Big Mountain provides even though it's pricing is already comparitively high for the State. That being said we wouldn't want to overestimate the increase customers are willing to pay and lose business to resorts currently at a lower price point."

This line of thinking led us to assume that there is a correlation between the services each resort offers and the associated ticket price customers are willing to pay. Along with the previous assumption, a key limitation we have is that we do not have complete pricing data for weekday and weekend ticket prices. However, because we have more complete data for weekend prices, we have decided to use weekend prices as our target to estimate.\n",

    "In conducting a correlation analysis we were able to immediately identify key services or features that we feel correlate well with weekend price, our target variable. From below we can see those features are: Vertical Drop, Snow Making (acres), Projected Days Open, Fast Quads, and Runs. Interestingly enough, some of the engineered features actually didn't correlate well with the target variable.\n",
